        Hi, my name is Kemal Durukan MERT. Welcome to my portfolio page!
        <br /><br /> I'm a Full Stack Developer based in Warsaw/POLAND. I am currently
        studying computer science in University of Economics and Human Science.
        I'm excited to learn new things and improve, lifetime student.
        <br /><br />I have a 3 years experience in IT and web development area. As a
        front-end developer, I have experience creating user-friendly and
        responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have
        experience working with popular front-end frameworks such as React. My
        projects showcase my ability to create clean, efficient, and visually
        appealing websites that are optimized for performance. <br /><br /> As a
        software engineering student, I have been exposed to various programming
        languages such as JavaScript and Python, and have learned how to design
        and implement complex software systems. My experience in software
        engineering has taught me the importance of writing efficient and
        maintainable code, as well as the importance of working collaboratively
        with a team. <br /><br /> In my portfolio, you will find examples of my work
        in front-end development. Whether it's building responsive websites,
        developing software applications, or designing intuitive user
        interfaces, I am committed to delivering high-quality work that meets
        the needs of my clients.
        <br /> <br />Thank you for visiting my portfolio page, and I look forward to
        hearing from you soon!
